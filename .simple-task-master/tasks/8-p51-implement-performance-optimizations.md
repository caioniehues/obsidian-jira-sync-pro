## Description
Add batch processing, caching, memory management, and debouncing for optimal sync performance

## Details
Process tickets in batches of 25 to avoid UI freezing. Use requestIdleCallback for non-critical updates. Cache plugin references to avoid repeated lookups. Store adapter state to avoid re-initialization. Implement debouncing for rapid sync requests. Clear event listeners on plugin unload. Dispose adapter resources properly. Limit in-memory ticket cache to 100 items. Add progress indicators for large syncs.

## Validation
Large syncs process in batches without UI blocking. Plugin references cached and reused. Memory usage stable during large operations. Rapid sync requests properly debounced. Resources cleaned up on plugin unload. Progress indicators show during bulk operations.
