## Description
Ensure runtime honors configuration settings for enabled integrations with proper user feedback

## Details
Technical Requirements:
- Fix disconnect where settings UI allows enabling integrations but runtime doesn't honor these settings
- Integrate configuration checking in main sync flow
- Add user feedback for integration sync results
- Ensure only enabled integrations are activated
- Respect settings changes at runtime without requiring plugin restart

Implementation Steps:
1. Fix sync flow in `main.ts performSync()` method
2. Add configuration checking before integration sync
3. Filter adapters based on enabled integrations setting
4. Add user notification for integration sync results
5. Ensure settings changes are respected at runtime

Complete Code Implementation:
```typescript
// In main.ts performSync()
if (this.integrationBridge && this.settings.enabledIntegrations?.length > 0) {
  // Only sync with enabled integrations
  const enabledAdapters = this.integrationBridge.getAdapters()
    .filter(a => this.settings.enabledIntegrations.includes(a.metadata.id));
  
  if (enabledAdapters.length > 0) {
    await this.integrationBridge.onTicketsSynced(result.issues);
    new Notice(`Synced to ${enabledAdapters.length} integration(s)`);
  }
}
```

Key Implementation Notes:
- Configuration check must happen BEFORE calling onTicketsSynced
- Filter adapters based on this.settings.enabledIntegrations array
- User notification shows exact count of integrations synced to
- Settings changes should be honored immediately without restart
- Empty or undefined enabledIntegrations should not trigger sync

## Validation
Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Only enabled integrations from settings receive sync events
- [ ] Users see notification showing number of integrations synced to
- [ ] Settings changes are respected without plugin restart
- [ ] Configuration validation prevents invalid states
- [ ] Tests verify settings integration works correctly

Test Scenarios:
1. All integrations enabled - all should receive sync events
2. Some integrations disabled - only enabled ones receive events
3. No integrations enabled - no sync events sent
4. Settings change during runtime - new settings respected immediately
5. Invalid integration IDs in settings - handled gracefully
6. User notification shows correct count of synced integrations

Validation Steps:
1. Test with different enabledIntegrations configurations
2. Verify adapter filtering based on settings
3. Test settings changes without plugin restart
4. Verify user notifications show correct counts
5. Test edge cases (empty array, undefined, invalid IDs)
6. Confirm no sync occurs when no integrations enabled
