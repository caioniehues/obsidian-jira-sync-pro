## Description
Fix the IntegrationBridge to properly propagate sync events to plugin adapters with error handling and configuration respect

## Details
Technical Requirements:
- Fix event propagation failure where IntegrationBridge receives sync events but doesn't properly propagate them to plugin adapters
- Ensure events reach active adapters based on configuration settings
- Add proper error handling and isolation between adapter failures
- Implement event bus integration for proper event flow

Implementation Steps:
1. Fix the `onTicketsSynced` method in `src/integrations/IntegrationBridge.ts` around line 420
2. Add proper event bus emission before direct adapter notification
3. Filter adapters based on `AdapterState.ACTIVE` and enabled integrations settings
4. Add error handling and logging for adapter failures
5. Ensure one adapter failure doesn't affect others

Complete Code Implementation:
```typescript
// Fix in IntegrationBridge.ts
public async onTicketsSynced(tickets: JiraTicket[]): Promise<void> {
  // Emit to event bus first
  this.eventBus.emit(JiraIntegrationEvent.TICKETS_SYNCED, { tickets });
  
  // Then directly notify active adapters
  for (const [id, adapter] of this.adapters) {
    if (adapter.state === AdapterState.ACTIVE && 
        this.plugin.settings.enabledIntegrations?.includes(id)) {
      try {
        await adapter.handleTicketSync(tickets);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Failed to sync with ${id}:`, error);
        this.eventBus.emitError('adapter-sync', error, { adapterId: id });
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Key Implementation Notes:
- Event bus emission must happen BEFORE adapter notification
- Filter adapters using both AdapterState.ACTIVE and settings.enabledIntegrations
- Each adapter call must be wrapped in try-catch for isolation
- Error events must include adapter ID for debugging
- Console logging provides immediate feedback during development

## Validation
Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Events are emitted to event bus before adapter notification
- [ ] Only active adapters with enabled integrations receive events
- [ ] Adapter failures are isolated and logged properly
- [ ] Error events are emitted to event bus with adapter ID context
- [ ] Tests verify event propagation to multiple adapters
- [ ] Tests verify configuration settings are respected
- [ ] Tests verify error isolation between adapters

Test Scenarios:
1. Multiple active adapters - all should receive events
2. Mixed active/inactive adapters - only active ones receive events
3. Adapter throws error - other adapters still receive events
4. Configuration disables integration - adapter doesn't receive events
5. Event bus receives both success and error events
6. Error context includes proper adapter ID for debugging

Validation Steps:
1. Create integration test with mock adapters
2. Verify event bus emission occurs first
3. Test adapter filtering based on state and configuration
4. Test error isolation by throwing in one adapter
5. Verify error events contain adapter context
6. Check console logging provides useful debugging info
