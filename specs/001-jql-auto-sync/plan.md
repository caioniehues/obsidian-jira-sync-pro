# Implementation Plan: JQL-based Auto-Sync

**Branch**: `001-jql-auto-sync` | **Date**: 2025-09-10 | **Spec**: [/Users/caio.niehues/ObsidianVault/.agent-os/specs/2025-09-10-jql-auto-sync/spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from existing documentation and Jira API deprecation notice

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
**Primary Requirement**: Implement automatic synchronization of Jira tickets using configurable JQL queries, eliminating manual ticket selection and ensuring all active work is synchronized to Obsidian every 5 minutes (configurable 1-60 min).

**Technical Approach**: Migrate from deprecated Jira API endpoints to new v3 JQL search endpoints with token-based pagination, implement progressive bulk import system for initial setup, and create auto-sync scheduler with exponential backoff error recovery. Critical: Must handle API migration from POST /rest/api/3/search to POST /rest/api/3/search/jql with new pagination model (nextPageToken vs startAt).

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 4.9+ with Obsidian Plugin API v1.4.0+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Obsidian Plugin API, Jira REST API v3, requestUrl() for HTTP calls  
**Storage**: Obsidian vault markdown files, plugin settings via saveData()/loadData()  
**Testing**: Jest with timer mocking for scheduler testing  
**Target Platform**: Obsidian desktop (cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single project (Obsidian plugin architecture)  
**Performance Goals**: Sync 100 tickets in <30 seconds, UI responsive during operations, <20 API calls/minute  
**Constraints**: No blocking operations, <50MB memory for 500 tickets, respect Jira rate limits (60 req/min)  
**Scale/Scope**: Handle up to 1000 tickets per sync, 5 configurable sync queries, progressive batch processing (25-50 tickets/batch)

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**: ✅ PASS
- Projects: 1 (single Obsidian plugin project)
- Using framework directly? Yes (Obsidian Plugin API directly, no wrappers)
- Single data model? Yes (JiraIssue, SyncConfig - no DTOs, direct API response mapping)
- Avoiding patterns? Yes (direct API calls, no Repository/UoW - appropriate for plugin architecture)

**Architecture**: ✅ PASS
- EVERY feature as library? Yes (JQLQueryEngine, AutoSyncScheduler, BulkImportManager as separate classes)
- Libraries listed: JQLQueryEngine (query execution), AutoSyncScheduler (interval management), BulkImportManager (batch processing), SyncStatusView (dashboard)
- CLI per library: N/A for Obsidian plugins, but Command Palette entries provided (manual sync, open settings, show status)
- Library docs: llms.txt format in progress (existing specs serve as initial docs)

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Timer mocking issues need resolution
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes (tasks.md shows tests written first)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes (existing pattern followed)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes (planned execution order)
- Real dependencies used? Yes (actual Jira API, real Obsidian vault operations)
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes (planned for API migration)
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase - Violated in some scheduler tests due to Jest timer conflicts

**Observability**: ✅ PASS
- Structured logging included? Yes (via Obsidian Notice system and console logging)
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A (single-process plugin)
- Error context sufficient? Yes (error collection, retry tracking, user-friendly messages)

**Versioning**: ✅ PASS  
- Version number assigned? Yes (will follow plugin manifest.json versioning)
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes (Obsidian plugin standard)
- Breaking changes handled? Yes (API migration plan with fallback support)

└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base template
- Generate contract test tasks from contracts/ directory:
  - `jql-search.yaml` → Contract tests for new Jira API endpoints [P]
  - `bulk-import.yaml` → Contract tests for progressive import operations [P] 
  - `config-management.yaml` → Contract tests for settings management [P]
- Generate data model implementation tasks from `data-model.md`:
  - JQLAutoSyncConfig interface and validation [P]
  - SyncProgress tracking structures [P]
  - BulkImportProgress with resume capability [P]
  - JQLSearchResult for new API response format [P]
  - SyncError structured error handling [P]
  - SyncStatistics aggregation logic [P]
- Extract integration test scenarios from `quickstart.md`:
  - Basic auto-sync setup (User Story 1)
  - Progressive bulk import (User Story 2)  
  - Team query configuration (User Story 3)
  - Error handling and recovery (Technical requirements)
  - API migration compatibility (Critical deadline requirement)
- Generate implementation tasks to make tests pass:
  - Migrate JQLQueryEngine to new API endpoints
  - Implement AutoSyncScheduler with interval management
  - Build BulkImportManager with progress UI
  - Create JQLAutoSyncSettingTab configuration panel
  - Develop SyncStatusView dashboard component

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **TDD Strict Order**: Contract tests → Data model tests → Integration tests → Implementation
- **API Migration Priority**: New endpoint tests FIRST (May 1, 2025 deadline)
- **Dependency Resolution**: 
  1. Core data models (no dependencies)
  2. JQL engine (depends on models)
  3. Sync scheduler (depends on engine) 
  4. Bulk import (depends on scheduler)
  5. UI components (depend on all services)
- **Parallel Execution**: Mark [P] for tasks operating on independent files
- **Critical Path**: API migration tasks get highest priority

**Task Categories and Estimated Counts**:
- Contract Tests: 6 tasks (2 per contract)
- Data Model Implementation: 12 tasks (2 per entity)
- Integration Tests: 10 tasks (2 per scenario)  
- Service Implementation: 8 tasks (JQL engine, scheduler, bulk import, status)
- UI Implementation: 6 tasks (settings panel, progress modal, status view)
- API Migration: 4 tasks (endpoint migration, pagination, error handling, testing)
- Error Recovery: 3 tasks (retry logic, circuit breaker, user notifications)

**Special Considerations**:
- Timer mocking issues in scheduler tests need resolution (documented violation)
- API deprecation deadline requires migration tasks in first sprint
- Bulk import resume functionality needs careful state management
- Rate limiting implementation must respect new API constraints
- Progress UI must handle cancellation and pause/resume operations

**Risk-Based Task Prioritization**:
1. **High Risk/High Impact**: API migration tasks (external deadline)
2. **High Impact/Medium Risk**: Core sync functionality (user-facing features)
3. **Medium Impact/Low Risk**: UI polish and dashboard features
4. **Low Impact**: Statistics and monitoring (nice-to-have)

**Estimated Output**: 45-50 numbered, sequenced tasks in tasks.md with clear dependencies and parallel execution markers

**Test Strategy Integration**:
- Every task references specific test scenarios from quickstart.md
- Contract tests must fail initially (RED phase requirement)
- Integration tests validate complete user workflows
- Performance tests validate specification requirements
- API migration tests ensure compatibility and deadline compliance

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Timer test mocking conflicts | Jest timer mocking prevents proper TDD for scheduler tests (10/20 tests affected) | Direct time manipulation would make tests unreliable and non-deterministic |
| Implementation before test in scheduler | Scheduler functionality needed for immediate user value | Waiting for test framework resolution would delay critical auto-sync feature |
