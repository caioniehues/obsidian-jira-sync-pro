# Error Handling Integration Test Summary

**Test File**: `tests/integration/error-handling.test.ts`  
**Task**: T016 [P] Integration test for Error Handling and Recovery  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All tests failing as required by TDD

## TDD Compliance ✅

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT MET**: All 13 tests FAIL initially as required by Test-Driven Development principles.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Network Connectivity Error Handling
- **Network disconnection with exponential backoff**: Tests retry logic with 1s, 2s, 4s delays
- **User notification during network issues**: Validates user-facing error messages  
- **Automatic recovery**: Tests network restoration and operation continuation

### 2. Invalid JQL Query Handling  
- **JQL syntax validation**: Tests various invalid query patterns
- **Helpful error suggestions**: Tests correction suggestions for common mistakes
- **Clear error messaging**: Validates user-friendly error descriptions

### 3. Authentication Failure Scenarios
- **401 error handling**: Tests credential refresh prompting
- **Token expiration**: Tests automatic token renewal mechanisms  
- **Authentication recovery**: Tests credential validation and retry

### 4. Rate Limiting and Exponential Backoff
- **Rate limit detection**: Tests 429 response handling with retry-after headers
- **Exponential backoff**: Tests 30s, 60s, 120s backoff progression
- **Request queuing**: Tests request management during rate limit periods

### 5. Error State Management and Recovery  
- **Error state persistence**: Tests sync status dashboard error tracking
- **Multi-operation coordination**: Tests recovery coordination across operations
- **System health monitoring**: Tests health status and recovery events

### 6. Integration Error Scenarios
- **Cascading failures**: Tests multiple simultaneous error types during bulk import
- **Partial sync failures**: Tests individual ticket failure isolation and recovery

## Test Failures Analysis

All tests fail due to **missing implementations**:

1. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff mechanisms not implemented
2. **Error Recovery**: Automatic recovery systems not built  
3. **User Notifications**: Error notification system not available
4. **JQL Validation**: Query syntax checking not implemented
5. **Credential Management**: Authentication refresh system not built
6. **Rate Limit Handling**: Rate limiting detection and queuing not available
7. **Error State Tracking**: Sync status dashboard error persistence not built
8. **Recovery Coordination**: Multi-operation recovery orchestration not implemented

## Quickstart Guide Scenario Coverage

✅ **Scenario 4: Error Handling and Recovery** - Complete coverage:
- Network issues during sync with retry behavior ✅
- Invalid JQL query handling with clear messages ✅  
- Jira authentication failure scenarios ✅
- Rate limiting with appropriate delays ✅
- Successful recovery after issues resolve ✅
- Error state display in sync status dashboard ✅

## Expected Development Flow

1. **Phase 1**: Implement basic error detection and classification
2. **Phase 2**: Build retry mechanisms with exponential backoff  
3. **Phase 3**: Add user notification and error messaging systems
4. **Phase 4**: Implement recovery coordination and state management
5. **Phase 5**: Build rate limiting and request queuing systems
6. **Phase 6**: Add authentication and credential management
7. **Phase 7**: Integrate error handling across all components

## Success Criteria for Implementation

When implementation is complete, tests should validate:

- ✅ Network errors trigger retry with exponential backoff (30s, 60s, 120s)
- ✅ Users receive clear notifications during connectivity issues  
- ✅ Invalid JQL queries are rejected with helpful suggestions
- ✅ Authentication failures prompt credential refresh
- ✅ Rate limiting is respected with queue management
- ✅ Automatic recovery when issues are resolved
- ✅ Error states are displayed in sync status dashboard
- ✅ Cascading failures are handled gracefully
- ✅ Partial failures are isolated and recovered individually

## Test Structure Benefits

1. **Comprehensive**: Covers all error scenarios from specification
2. **Realistic**: Uses actual error conditions and responses
3. **Maintainable**: Clear test organization and helper utilities
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new error scenarios as needed
5. **Contract-Driven**: Defines clear interfaces and expected behaviors

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run error handling integration tests
npm test -- tests/integration/error-handling.test.ts

# Expected Result: 13 tests failing (TDD requirement)
# Tests:       13 failed, 13 total
```

**Next Steps**: Begin implementing error handling components to make tests pass incrementally, following TDD red-green-refactor cycle.
